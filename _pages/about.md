## A short introduction
Hello and welcome to my personal page! I am proud to share with you a journey that intertwines rigorous academics with a passion for engineering innovation.

I embarked on this path at the esteemed [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/), where from 2019 to 2023, I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Electronic Information Engineering. My commitment to excellence was reflected in my GPA of 88/100, placing me in the top 10% of my class. This foundation equipped me with a deep understanding of electronics and information systems, setting the stage for a lifelong pursuit of technological advancement.

Currently, I am honing my skills as a Master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology. 

My academic pursuits are more than just a path to a degree; they are a testament to my dedication to contributing to the field of engineering. I invite you to explore my portfolio, where you'll find a blend of academic achievements and projects that encapsulate my enthusiasm for creating a smarter and more efficient future through engineering.

Thank you for stopping by, and I look forward to connecting with you!
