This project makes an image compression system based on the JPEG compression standard. The image is firstly segmented, then DCT transformed, and then quantized according to the given quantization table. The DC component is differentially encoded, the AC component is run-length encoded, and the data is then Huffman encoded.This system will eventually output the compressed image and calculate the compression ratio.
