According to the short-term stationarity of the speech signal, the collected speech signal is processed frame by frame, the prediction coefficient is calculated by the linear prediction method (LPC), and the gene cycle is changed to achieve different voice changing effects. And compiled a GUI interface to integrate audio acquisition, spectrum analysis, voice-changing processing functions, and finally realized the voice-changing effects of children's voices, female voices, sloth voices, etc.
