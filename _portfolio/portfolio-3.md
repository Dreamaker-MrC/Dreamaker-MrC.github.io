The project was done in two ways. The first approach uses principal component analysis (PCA) to extract feature faces from face sample sets. Fisher Linear Discrimination method is used for face classification and recognition. The second approach uses HOG operator to extract feature faces, and then uses multi-layer feedforward neural network to classify and recognize faces.
