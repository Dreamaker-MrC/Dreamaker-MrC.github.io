This study introduces a comprehensive voice change processing system developed in MATLAB, which capitalizes on the short-term stationarity characteristic of speech signals. The system processes collected speech signals on a frame-by-frame basis, utilizing the Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) method to calculate prediction coefficients. By modifying the pitch period, it facilitates the creation of various voice-changing effects. Furthermore, the system features a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that consolidates audio acquisition, spectrum analysis, and voice change processing into a single, user-friendly platform. This integration allows for the seamless generation of altered voice outputs, such as childrenâ€™s voices, female voices, and sloth voices, among others. This system represents a significant advancement in voice processing technology, offering a versatile tool for a wide range of applications.
