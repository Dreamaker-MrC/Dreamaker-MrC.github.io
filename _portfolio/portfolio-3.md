In this project, we implemented an Airhockey game using the Nexys A7-100T FPGA board. The game is designed to be interactive, utilizing two matrix keyboards as input devices for players to control their paddles. For the visual aspect, the game generates VGA signals to display the game interface, including the puck, paddles, and scoring, on a VGA monitor. This setup not only demonstrates the FPGA's capability to handle real-time inputs and outputs but also showcases the potential for creating engaging, hardware-accelerated games.
