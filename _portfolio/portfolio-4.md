Use PIXHAWK flight control hardware to build a four-axis UAV experimental platform. The UAV uses mini lidar and Optical Flow sensor to determine altitude and stabilize its position. The Hough circle change algorithm is used to identify the position of a specific shape, and a negative feedback control system is used to make the UAV hover over the specified target to achieve the function of tracking the target.
