This study presents the development of a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) tracking system, leveraging the OPENMV platform for precise target monitoring. The system is built upon a quadcopter testbed equipped with PIXHAWK flight control hardware, augmented by miniature LIDAR and optical flow sensors to maintain stability and navigation at elevated altitudes. Target tracking is achieved through the implementation of the Hough circle change algorithm, which identifies and locates specific shapes. Additionally, a negative feedback control mechanism is employed to maintain the UAV's position directly above the target, ensuring continuous and accurate monitoring. This innovative approach provides a robust solution for UAV-based surveillance and tracking applications.
