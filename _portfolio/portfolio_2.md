This research outlines a novel speaker verification system that integrates high-resolution millimeter wave radar with vocal cord vibration analysis. By utilizing radar to detect vocal cord vibrations during speech, the system processes reflected signals with a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to isolate phase information. This data is used to identify distinct biometric features from speech segments, which are analyzed by a deep CNN for accurate speaker verification. This approach offers a sophisticated, non-invasive solution for secure individual authentication through unique speech patterns.
