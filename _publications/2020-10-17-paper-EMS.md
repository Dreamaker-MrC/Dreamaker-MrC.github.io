excerpt: 'Under the epidemic background, contactless human-computer interaction has great application prospects in the medical and health field. Among them, gesture recognition is a research hotspot in non-contact instrument control. To improve the robustness and efficiency of gesture recognition, this paper proposes a method to realize gesture digital recognition based on dual-view sequence feature fusion of millimeter wave radar. Firstly, time series echo data of millimeter-wave radar gesture numbers 0-9 from frontal and lateral perspectives are collected synchronously. Secondly, Data-sets from different perspectives are preprocessed by implementing clutter suppression and data compression. Furthermore, the Attention Dual View Fusion Network (ADVFNet) embedded with temporal Attention mechanism is constructed based on the intrinsic correlation of temporal features. Finally, using the collected data-set, the proposed network could be trained, and time-series feature fusion and gesture digital recognition could be completed. Experimental results show that the recognition accuracy of the proposed method on the actual radar data-set is over 95%, where it has faster network convergence, and better model generalization ability, compared with the existing methods. Moreover, the method could provide a new idea for the follow-up human-computer interaction of millimeter-wave radar.'
