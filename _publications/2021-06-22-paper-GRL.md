excerpt: 'In modern electronic warfare, cognitive radar with knowledge-aided waveforms would show significant flexibility in anti-interference. In this paper, a novel method, named particle swarm-assisted projection optimization (PSAP), is introduced to design phase-coded waveforms with multi-level low range sidelobes, which mainly considers the stability for randomized initialization under the unimodular constraint. Firstly, the mathematical problem corresponding to avoid the range sidelobe masking from multiple non-cooperative targets or interference is formulated by giving different threat levels. Then, based on the alternating direction decomposition idea, the original problem is divided into triple-variable ones where these non-linear approximations can be solved via alternating projections along with FFT. Furthermore, the PSAP method with swarm intelligence, learning factor, and particle-assisted projection could ensure the optimization convergence in a parallel way, which could relax the non-convex constraint and enhance the global exploiting performance. Finally, simulations for several typical scenarios and numerical results are all provided to assess the waveforms generated by PSAP and other prevalent ones.'
